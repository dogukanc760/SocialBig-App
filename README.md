# Social-Big Mongodb Express React Nodejs App
This application has been prepared and installed by me as MERN Stack. There is also a Socket.io application in the background designed with MongoDB Express React and Nodejs. It works in real time like many well-known social media applications.
# What to do after downloading or cloning the app
If you are using yarn,
You need to run yarn add command in terminal.
If you are using npm,
You will need to run the npm install command. Of course, you have to write these commands separately in the api and client directories.
